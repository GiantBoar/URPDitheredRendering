*dithered shader in the unviersal render pipeline for unity*

![Lighthouse Header](https://giantboar.com/assets/postassets/20240530/shader-step-4.png)

**WARNING:** this repository doesn't have project files, so you can't use it as a unity project, it only contains the base scripts, the dithering shadergraph, and the bayer matrix texture. If you intend to use this in your unity project, I suggest you refer to the blog post [here](https://giantboar.com/posts/Dithered-Rendering/)

Good luck and happy rendering
